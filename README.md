AWS Credential Profiles
Most AWS tools support the ~/.aws/credentials file for storing credentials, allowing you to specify AWS_PROFILE environment variable so Up knows which one to reference. To read more on configuring these files view Configuring the AWS CLI.

Hereâ€™s an example of ~/.aws/credentials, where export AWS_PROFILE=myaccount would activate these settings.

```bash
[myaccount]
aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxxx
aws_secret_access_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Deploy

```bash
# deploy cloudquery
up

# get cloudquery base URL
up url
```
